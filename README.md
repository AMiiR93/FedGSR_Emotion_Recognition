# FedGSR_Emotion_Recognition

This is a Deep Learning method for recognizing emotions based on analyzing the Physiological Siganl - GSR

In this implementation, We are going to analyze the Federated architecture and compare it with Centeralized Architecture.

as DNN models, CNNs, LSTMs, and RNNs are implemented for this purpose.
